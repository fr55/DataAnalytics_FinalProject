Notes:               This data series illustrates the movement of exports from the given
                     state to the given country. A missing observation can mean two things.
                     First, missing observations can appear because no exports were made to
                     the listed country that year. Secondly, it could signify a low number
                     of exporters thus giving away proprietary data away.
