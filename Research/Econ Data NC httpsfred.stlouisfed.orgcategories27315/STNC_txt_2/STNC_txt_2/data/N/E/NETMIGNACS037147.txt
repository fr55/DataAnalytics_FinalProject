Notes:               The American Community Survey (ACS) and the Puerto Rico Community
                     Survey (PRCS) ask respondents age 1 year and over whether they lived
                     in the same residence 1 year ago. For people who lived in a different
                     residence, the location of their previous residence is collected.
                     
                     ACS uses a series of monthly samples to produce estimates. The 5-year
                     dataset is used for the county-to-county migration flows since many
                     counties have a population less than 20,000.
