Notes:               The poverty universe is made up of persons for whom the Census Bureau
                     can determine poverty status (either in poverty or not in poverty).
                     The definition of poverty universe for SAIPE estimates is the same for
                     2006 and beyond and conceptually matches the poverty universe of the
                     American Community Survey (ACS). The poverty universe estimates are
                     not the same as the population estimates from the Census Bureau's
                     Population Estimates Program. Instead, they are derived estimates that
                     differ from population estimates in the following ways. Beginning with
                     2006, the poverty universe includes group quarters populations only
                     for noninstitutionalized group quarters, not elsewhere classified.
                     Residents of college dormitories, military housing, and all
                     institutional group quarters populations are excluded (this marks a
                     break in the see discuss later in this note). The poverty universe
                     does not include children under the age of 15 who are not related to a
                     reference person within the household by way of birth, marriage or
                     adoption (for example, foster children). The reason is that Census
                     Bureau surveys typically ask income questions only of persons age 15
                     or older and those under 15 related to a reference person within the
                     household.
                     
                     The 2005 poverty universe estimates excluded all group quarters'
                     residents, matching the definition of the 2005 ACS. Prior to the
                     estimates for 2005, the poverty universe data were derived from the
                     Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population
                     Survey. This marks a break in the data series due to a methodology
                     change.
