Notes:               The BLS defines discouraged workers as persons who are not in the
                     labor force, want and are available for work, and had looked for a job
                     sometime in the prior 12 months. They are not counted as unemployed
                     because they had not searched for work in the prior 4 weeks, for the
                     specific reason that they believed no jobs were available to them.
