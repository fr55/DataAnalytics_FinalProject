Notes:               As stated by the source, these annual county indexes should be
                     considered developmental. As with the standard FHFA HPIs, revisions to
                     these indexes may reflect the impact of new data or technical
                     adjustments. Indexes are calibrated using appraisal values and sales
                     prices for mortgages bought or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie
                     Mac. As discussed in the Working Paper 16-01, in cases where sample
                     sizes are small for the county area, an index is either not reported
                     if recording has not started or a missing value is reported with a
                     period (.). Index values always reflect the native county index, i.e.
                     they are not made with data from another area or year.
