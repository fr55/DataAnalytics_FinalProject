Notes:               The BLS defines marginally attached workers as persons who are not in
                     the labor force, want and are available for work, and had looked for a
                     job sometime in the prior 12 months. They are not counted as
                     unemployed because they had not searched for work in the prior 4
                     weeks, for any reason whatsoever. The marginally attached are a group
                     that includes discouraged workers.
