Notes:               Overview of the Index
                     The Index is a quarterly comprehensive picture of the average American
                     household’s financial condition. Built by assessing the key elements
                     of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors
                     into a single, easy to understand number.
                     
                     Scope and History
                     The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The
                     national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions
                     date back to 1990.
                     
                     Public Data and Proprietary Methodology
                     We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private
                     data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and
                     evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into
                     helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of
                     distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven
                     strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data
                     source for the Index)
                     
                     Measured on a 100 Point Scale
                     Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under
                     70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more
                     distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes
                     longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of
                     needing a third party help to resolve.
                     
                     The Index score is tied to one of 5 general rating categories, which
                     reflect the strength and stability of the consumer’s position.
                     Less than 60 Emergency / Crisis
                     60 – 69 Distressed / Unstable
                     70 – 79 Weakening / At-Risk
                     80 – 89 Good / Stable
                     90 and Above Excellent / Secure
                     
                     What Does the Index Measure?
                     We measure the 5 categories of personal finance that reflect or lead
                     to a secure, stable financial life—Employment, Housing, Credit,
                     Household Budget and Net Worth. All are equally important, so have
                     given each category equal weighting.
                     
                     Employment. Stable income is the foundation of any family’s
                     finances. This category measures the impact of unemployment and
                     underemployment on financial health.
                     Key Measures: Unemployment, Underemployment
                     Sample Data Source: Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics
                     
                     Housing. Safe, affordable housing is a priority for all families. This
                     category measures how consumers are paying their mortgage/rent and the
                     impact of housing costs on their finances.
                     Key Measures: Mortgage and Rental Delinquencies, Housing as Percent of
                     Budget
                     Sample Data Source: National Delinquency Survey
                     
                     Credit. Responsible use of credit creates more borrowing options and
                     lower costs. This category assesses the strength of credit scores and
                     how well families manage their credit.
                     Key Measures: Credit Scores, Trade Line Utilization, Credit
                     Delinquencies, Per Capita Bankruptcies
                     Sample Data Source: National Credit Bureau
                     
                     Household Budget. Spending less than you make is the daily choice that
                     leads to long-term success. This category measures families’
                     spending patterns and saving for emergencies.
                     Key Measures: Disposable Income, Savings, Consumer Confidence

                     Net Worth. Strong, positive net worth creates options and
                     independence. This category measures how well consumers are
                     strengthening their personal balance sheets.
                     Key Measures: Household Net Worth, Net Worth versus Funds Required for
                     Long-Term Needs (e.g. retirement)
