Notes:               The SNAP data are used in the production of the Census Small Area
                     Income and Poverty estimates (SAIPE). This release is located at
                     production purposes (http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/index.html).
                     The SNAP data set is not raw SNAP data. Below are some details about
                     the reference periods, averages computed, raking/scaling done, and
                     imputations done, which make the data most suitable for SAIPE
                     production purposes, but which also apply to the posted SNAP data,

                     The county-level SNAP data are almost always in reference to July of
                     the given year, except in a small number of instances another nearby
                     month had to be used. The numbers are usually a snapshot as of the end
                     of the month, start of the month, or middle of the month, and
                     occasionally can be a measure of anyone enrolled any time during that
                     month. Also, not all states compile their figures exactly the same
                     way.
                     
                     Annual county-level data are controlled data are controlled to sum to
                     the twelve-month average of the state data in the following way: Add
                     up the county-level July 20YY data in each state, and compare it to
                     the 12-month average of the state-level July 20YY through Jun 20YY+1
                     data. Then scale the county-level data up or down in such a way that
                     the state sum of county-level data exactly equals the 12-month average
                     of the state-level data. For example, with the July 2012 SNAP data,
                     the Census controls the county sums to equal the state 12-month
                     average of July 2012 through July 2013 data. After this scaling (i.e.,
                     raking) is done, note that the resulting 12-month average county-level
                     SNAP data, at the state level, are centered in time around Dec 20YY
                     and Jan 20YY+1, which is about six months farther in the future than
                     the original July 20YY county-level SNAP data. However, the
                     county-level sub-detail still refers to the July 20YY timeframe.
                     
                     Importantly, note that a small number of "anomalous" data points are
                     "imputed" prior to posting. Sometimes, there may be large but
                     temporary data drop-offs in a small number of counties that appear to
                     have had reporting issues for the given time period. In such cases the
                     Census may replace the anomalous county-level data as needed to run
                     our SAIPE production processes. For example, the Census replaced
                     anomalous data with an average of the prior and next year of data, or
                     the Census may apply that county's last-year SNAP rate scaled up by
                     the year/year percent change in the state SNAP rate, etc. Especially,
                     when there are officially-declared natural disasters, states may
                     loosen the normal SNAP eligibility criteria, and there may temporarily
                     be many more SNAP enrollees. As a result, the more typical relation
                     between SNAP and poverty status is broken. For SAIPE to still use such
                     SNAP data in our models, the Census need to first remove such
                     disaster-generated spikes and replace them with seasonally-adjusted
                     predictions. For example, in the raw SNAP data, in Louisiana, there
                     was a spike for a couple months in late 2005, however, in the posted
                     SNAP data; the Census has removed those one-time spikes.
