Notes:               Regional price parities (RPPs) are regional price levels expressed as
                     a percentage of the overall national price level for a given year. The
                     price levels are determined by the average prices paid by consumers
                     for the mix of goods and services consumed in each region. Taking the
                     ratio of RPPs shows the difference in price levels across regions.
                     
                     Rents RPPs are estimated only for observed tenants' rents and do not
                     include imputed owner-occupied rent values.
